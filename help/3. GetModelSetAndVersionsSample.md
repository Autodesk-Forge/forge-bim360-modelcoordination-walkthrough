# Get Information on Modelset and Version

## Description
This sample will get detail information of one modelset and its versions. This modelset is normally created by [2. CreateModelSetSample](./2.%20CreateModelSetSample.md).

## Steps
1. Ensure dependent packages of nuGet have been installed, and dependent project [Forge ](../samples/auxiliary/Forge) has been built and imported sucessfully. 
2. Ensure ` SampleConfiguration.json ` has been configured with _hub id_, _project id_ and _valid token_. Please check [RuntimeConfig.md](../RuntimeConfig.md) on how to generate ` SampleConfiguration.json `.
3. Ensure ` CreateModelSetSampleState.json ` is available in user's default profile directory. This json file is generated by the sample [2. CreateModelSetSample](./2.%20CreateModelSetSample.md).
4. Build the sample and run.
5. The code will get information about the model set and its versions. If everything works well, it will print out the message with success.
